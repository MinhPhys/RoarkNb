All the examples are built using the jupyter widget libraries ([ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Widget%20List.html) and [bqplot](https://bqplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). [voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) is used to render the notebooks as code less dashboards.
